## General info
This "project" is for Computer Networks.
It divides a given network into subnets, making calculations easier.

## Setup
To run this calculator you must have Oracle OpenJDK version 22 and IDE or something where you can run this code.
When you run the code, you must give to the terminal information about network you want to divine and amount of
this divines. Your result will be save in separate file, so be careful and don't rage when you will see only
information about IP class in terminal. To change file you must change fileName in this line: 
``` java
FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("Podzia≈ÇSieci.txt");
```
You can change "PodzialSieci.txt" for everything you want and can.

That's all, have fun and told me about some bugs.
